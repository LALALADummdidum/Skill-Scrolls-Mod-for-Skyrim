The following things are the scripts ive used for the effects:

		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Block", Advancement)															                                                                                                 	 															
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("HeavyArmor", Advancement)
    Game.IncrementSkillBy("Smithing", Advancement) 		
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("TwoHanded", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Marksman", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("LightArmor", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Sneak", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Lockpicking", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Pickpocket", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Speechcraft", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Alchemy", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Illusion", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Conjuration", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Destruction", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Restoration", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Alteration", Advancement)
		Game.IncrementSkillBy("Enchanting", Advancement)
    Game.IncrementSkillBy("OneHanded", Advancement)
    Game.IncrementSkillBy("Enchanting", Advancement)


The scripts are just the following:

Event OnEffectStart(Actor akTarget, Actor akCaster)

Game.IncrementSkillBy("Enchanting", Advancement)
	
endEvent


Advancement means how many levels it should go up. The script is supposed to be just copied under the "extends activemagiceffect" 

Event OnEffectStart(Actor akTarget, Actor akCaster)

Game.IncrementSkillBy("Enchanting", 1)
	
endEvent

The Script above should increase the Enchanting Skill by 1 Level.

If I mean leveled up by one level, I mean that it levels just up like normally.
Ive just extracted the scripts from the Oghma Infinium so theyre pretty easy to find. (I couldnt find them in any Wiki.)

Ive also used the following Scripts for the Mod Image:
(Im really bad at graphics design so Ive programmed a bit in HTML and  then I did a Screenshot)

The HTML Script:

<html>
	
	<head>
		<title>Skyrim Skill Scrolls Mod Page</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="format.css" type="text/css">
	</head>
	<body>
	<br> <br>
	 <h1>Skyrim Skill Scrolls Mod</h1>
	</body>
</html>


The CSS Script:

body{
		background-color: black;
		font-family: Courier New;
		font-size:   500%; 
		text-align:center;
		color:	white;
		align-items: center;
		height: 100%;
	}

Im just going to write down the loottable of the Different Scrolls

Level 1 Scrolls are supposed to be sold from different NPCs. Im adding them to the General Merchants for first.


A scroll is guaranteed from the following NPCs

Level 5 Scrolls:
Draugr Scourge Lord
Overlord
Imperial Fort Commander
Imperial Officers (All the Normal Legates)

Briarheart
Every Member of the dark Brotherhood except for Adtrid. (The Members dont drop anything if they die during the Normal Dark Brotherhood Questline. They only drop if you side with the Penitus Oculatus.)

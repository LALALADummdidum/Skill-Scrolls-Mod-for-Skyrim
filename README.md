Im just going to write down the loottable of the Different Scrolls

Note: I recommend looking at the raw file, It looks way better

A scroll is guaranteed from the following NPCs:

  Draugr Scourge Lord

  Imperial Fort Commander
  Imperial Officers (All the Normal Legates)

  Astrid
 
Level 25 Scrolls:
